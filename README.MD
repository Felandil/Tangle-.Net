# Build Status

## Motivation

As a C# developer it was very frustrating that the current IOTA C# lib is pretty much outdated. Therefore this project was born.
The project was set up a little different from most (except the python one) IOTA libs, since Clean Architecture enables you to follow the SOLID principles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) pretty easy.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, please feel free to grab an issue. To get your code into the repository please fork it and create a pull request with your changes.

## Encryption

The library uses the C# Port of Bouncy Castle (http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/).

## NuGet

Even though I like package managers, I decided to not make the project available via NuGet, since sensitive data (your seed) plays a crucial role.

Here is why:

If you want to use the package for your own development I suggest to to check it out as a submodule and compile it within your project.

## Note

The project is still in development. Therefore breaking changes may occur.
You can reach me via iota Discord (@Felandil) if you've got any questions.

## Getting started

Have a look at the console application or start by instantiating a new repository!

```javascript
var repository = new RestIotaRepository(new RestClient("https://localhost:14265"));
var nodeInfo = repository.GetNodeInfo();
var neighbours = repository.GetNeighbors();
```
